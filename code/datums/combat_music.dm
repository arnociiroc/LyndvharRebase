/*
	Combat Mode Music Track Datums
	---
	Currently only used for overriding the default combat music that comes with your job or antagonist.
	As of writing they are never directly applied to mobs themselves, only the name and musicpath are.
	Deleting these datums or renaming subtypes will not break preferences; invalid saves get redirected to /default.
	When adding new songs, add a shortname around ~12 characters for the game preferences menu.
	
	IMPORTANT! Be careful about adding songs to this list that aren't used anywhere else, lest you needlessly inflate the RSC.
