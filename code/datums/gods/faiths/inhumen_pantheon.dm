	desc = "The Archdaemons are the beings born from the worst sinful parts of mortals, given form as monstrous deities representing these. They began the BLOODWAKE in an attempt to usurp the PANTHEON and bring about an age of destruction and calamity and reshape Beowricke in their own sinful image. Despite this, there are many shady organizations and those of corruption who worship these beings in secret, awaiting their return. Archdaemon worship is utterly detested and hated by almost all organized faiths, and is met quickly with the pyre or the sword when uncovered."
