DECA: ASTRATA - 1:1... ASTRATA was the FIRST to notice the plight of PSYDONIA. Seeing PSYDON's ABANDONMENT, did she awaken the PANTHEON to save MORTALKIND in our FOLLEY.
DECA: NOC - 1:3... NOC's first blessings in PSYDON's abandonment, great magicks which filled the halls of THE HOLY CELESTIAL. So too could MORTALKIND wield ARCYNE MIGHT.

DECA: NOC 3:18... Embracing the profound silence of night, we find Noc's wisdom—a silent, ever-present guide.
DECA: NOC-DENDOR 11:13... Dendor’s curse ravaged the land, scorned by Astrata’s fire and light but Noc was curious of the beast-men. While Astrata suppressed them. He would hide them in his light and use it to grant them and embolden their gift. He would watch closely.
DECA: XYLIX - 1:5... The GREAT GAME was RIGGED against the INFIDEL. The dice which rolled was TEN-SIDED. The AUDIENCE laughed as THE HOLY CELESTIAL took its place rightful seat of power.

DECA: PESTRA - 1:2... So did her teaching spread across the world, as she set the first bone and mended the first artery. Surgery, it was called.
DECA: PESTRA - 1:9... HER SERVANTS blackened the sky abuzz. The INFIDEL cried in TERROR at her ANGELS descent. A thousand slit palms of her devotees, did they lay their eggs in.
DECA: NECRA - 5:4... The dead shall rest eternum. Within HER grasp. The FAITHFUL have NAUGHT to fear of HER realm.

DECA: MALUM - 1:5... And so the Forgefather gave life to steele; from which His Devout would breathe effortless masterpieces into.
DECA: MALUM - 6:1... When the Works had challenged Him so; He would work tirelessly, ever devout, yet never showing His frustration.
DECA: XYLIX - 15:20... And so a lie was told to the thronebound Tyrant, that the Sun loved him, so that the truth of his actions would show the rightful heir how unfit the usurper was.
DECA: XYLIX - 2:5... How could He refuse, when the Sun herself came asking for help, showing humility in a time of need?
DECA: XYLIX - 2:9...and though, the kingdoms did fall and rise, the Dice continued to roll; and from this chaos and maelstrom gaindeth Xylix's glory.
DECA: EORA - 6:2... The Forgefather finally finished, and the statue held within it a beauty that Eora simply swooned over, a testament to the love of craft.
DECA: RAVOX - 7:1... Though outmatched, outnumbered and with inferior weapons, there the man stood... and He gave him the strength to see the fight to the end, for Justice is its own armor.
