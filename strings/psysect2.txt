LYFE 1:2... And when BEOWRICKE was finally wrought from star-and-clay, HE wearily looked upon his works and deemed it good; such christened the first SABBATH, and the first dae-of-rest.
LYFE 2:16... To bring LYFE to BEOWRICKE, HE molded the first MAN in HIS image; and by scraping LUX into their body, so to did HE gift them the divine connection to thought-and-will.
LYFE 3:27... When HE had used the last clumps for MAN, it was BEOWRICKE's animals who were brought forth to complete HIS world; a union of both MAN and MER, under HIS light.
LYFE 41:3... From the stars, there came a terrible sickness; a sudden malaise that violated the hearts of HIS children with sin, and brought forth the first daemons.
LYFE 42:23... This was the ARCHDAEMONS' terror; the antithesis to LYFE, of which they - driven by jealousy and hatred towards HIM - sought nothing less than to bring BEOWRICKE to ruin.
LYFE 43:61... Yet, those who kept faith in HIM were promised eternity in the paradise-to-come; even as the ARCHDAEMONS sired their ARMY OF DARKNESS, and even as HELL's jaws clamped onto BEOWRICKE.
LYFE 74:3... During the BLOODWAKE, upon the precipice of BEOWRICKE's collapse, did PSYDON'S blade crash down; a blinding light that destroyed the ARCHDAEMONS and - at last - drove their wretched forces back into HELL.
LYFE 75:19... HE had given everything to save BEOWRICKE, and had fallen into a thoughtless slumber; with what little strength remained, HE created the CHURCH OF VALORIA to shepherd LYFE in HIS absence.
LYFE 77:7... Just as HE did, so too must MAN now endure; for the ARCHDAEMONS' PROTIGEE and their UNHOLY TRINITY's temporary pleasures musn't outlast the eternal faith of PSYDON's children.
