DAWN: ASTRATA 5:7... Astrata is controlling over her creations, like a child with toys. If any violated what she considered a perfect world, She would focus her ire on them.. burning them to ash in her sight or weakening them when her ire is summoned by her followers.
DAWN: ASTRATA-NECRA 11:2... And the Tyrant she was, She would not let Necra take her creations. When invoked and informed of a creation laid to rest. Astrata's light would fill their vessel, pulling their soul from her grasp and bringing the vessel to life.. exhausting those who invoke her."
DAWN: NOC - 8:4... In the embrace of Noc's night, we find solace and wisdom, where the mysteries of existence come to light.
DAWN: NOC - 5:1... Noc looked upon the Student book clutched in hand and gave to him the knowledge of the world, The flow of Mana and the power within men at their fingertips, hidden by mere words.
DAWN: UNDIVIDED - 2:4... The UNDEAD SCOURGE, of the INHUMEN CREATION, could not break us. TEN ANGELS descended from on-high, slaughtering heretic and undeath alike. The TEN sacrificed their holiest of creations for us.

DAWN: NOC - 1:1... IAOTH spoke in wisdoms the greatest scholar could not comprehend. Hoarding secrets HE could collect from the devoted."
DAWN: DENDOR-NOC 1:3... And the Tides sang and rocked with the sounds of Dendorâ€™s winds and the strings of the waves pulled by Noc. They rocked the giant to rest so that he may not awaken from below the tides. The Slumbering Giant.
DAWN: XYLIX - 2:3... The GAMBLER VRETIEL came to us first, last, and center. To free our hearts with innate Chaos.
DAWN: XYLIX - 2:1... And so the TAROT told of FOUR INHUMEN BEASTS who would COME for HER HOLY EMPIRE. Promising lies and devouring SOULS.
DAWN: DENDOR - 2:1... The Beast ARUK slithered, flew, and burrowed. ASTERAOTH held it by a chain which gleamed both Moon and Sunlight. Purified Eclipsum held it taut for the ritual. 
DAWN: PESTRA - 2:6... A physician of elongated limbs and pallid complexion, USIEL,  came to us. Lesser men withered in HER wake. YET recovered in moments. 
DAWN: NECRA - 1:4... The first savior to arrive. CADRIEL rendered UNDEATH to DEATH like a scythe to chaff.
DAWN: ABYSSOR - 1:4... IT crawled from the SEA, NAMELESS THING. Our DREAMS twisted beautifully, many were lost to IT.
DAWN: EORA - 1:1... EIAEL comforted us when we were most afraid. Live in HER LOVE, and know that she of the TEN ANGELS loved us most as a mortal would.
DAWN: MALUM - 3:1... ASTRATA twisted the FORGEMASTER'S uncaring arm. So did he send a divine construct of his own making. Ithuriel was its name.

DAWN: XYLIX - 14:7... But a lot of good the bound labour did, for when the chains were slipped his slaves took to exacting their terrible revenge.
DAWN: XYLIX - 10:1... The first sight of the Sun after so long spent in utter darkness was His final gift to the band, a blessed reward for breaking free from their bonds.
DAWN: EORAN - 5:1... The two lovers nurtured their garden, letting none halt or dissuade them from their shared passions and mutual beauty.
DAWN: RAVOX - 4:5... It was the Justicar's hand that stayed the blade, for He objected to the execution, and demanded that Justice overcome where Vengeance reigned.
DAWN: RAVOX - 6:1... The warrior had just enough strength to see the fight through, finally driving his blade through the wretched hide of the beast and saving all, no matter the cost.
DAWN: ASTRATA - 5:4... Her wrath was great, and She would never forgive the thieves for their part in Her wounding, much to the dismay of Ravox and Xylix...
DAWN: XYLIX - 2:6... Donning a disguise, He went to a table one night while the Sun-Thief was cheating people of their wealth in a game of cards, only to swap his hand for the worst possible deal at the last second to give it back all away.
