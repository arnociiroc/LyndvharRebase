DAWN: ASTRATA 5:7... Astrata is controlling over her creations, like a child with toys. If any violated what she considered a perfect world, She would focus her ire on them.. burning them to ash in her sight or weakening them when her ire is summoned by her followers.
DAWN: ASTRATA-NECRA 11:2... And the Tyrant she was, She would not let Necra take her creations. When invoked and informed of a creation laid to rest. Astrata's light would fill their vessel, pulling their soul from her grasp and bringing the vessel to life.. exhausting those who invoke her."

DAWN: UNDIVIDED - 2:4... The UNDEAD SCOURGE, of the ARCHDAEMON CREATION, could not break us. TEN GODS descended from on-high, slaughtering heretic and undeath alike. The TEN sacrificed their holiest of creations for us.

DAWN: DENDOR-NOC 1:3... And the Tides sang and rocked with the sounds of Dendorâ€™s winds and the strings of the waves pulled by Noc. They rocked the giant to rest so that she may not awaken from below the tides. The Slumbering Giant.
