,e You will DIE in DARKNESS!
,e Your BLOOD will feed the hunger of the skrallax!
,e You DARE to challenge a child of the Underdark?
,e Weak - just like the rest of your kind!
,e I will CARVE OUT YOUR HEART for my mistress!
,e Matriarch's hand guides my blade!
,e Surrender and perhaps i'll grant you a quick death, yes?
,e Skewer them! Let their screams echo throughout the caverns!
,e Bleed, wretch! Your agony is a symphony to my ears!
,e Nothing but death awaits you down here, fool.
,e You are nothing but a worm beneath my heel. Perish!
,e Squirm, insect!
,e I want to hear you BEG before the end!
,e I'll take my time breaking you, piece by piece!
,e Another body for the skrallax to feast on! 
,e The Matriarch's will is absolute - your life ends here, fool!
,e Surrender now, and you might live as a slave!
,e Bow before my strength!
,e How dare you come down to our lands!
,e Interloper!
,e Fool!
,e You never should have came here!
,e Oh look, a surface-dweller come to offer themself!
,e Prepare for your end!
,e Beg for mercy- and watch as you receive nothing!
,e Mon dieu!
,e En garde!
,e C'est fini!
,e Effondrement dans le d√©sespoir!
,e Effondrer!
