Never should have come here!
Gonna cut your belly open like a blueblood's purse!
Your coin or your life!
Beware, stranger! Thou art being robbed!
Tragedy befalls ye!
Get 'em, boys!
Let's hope this one is more fun than the last!
Ground, NOW!
Start running!
Time to pay thine highway tax, sire!
This one looks like they've got something good!
Let's see if you put up a better fight than the last fool!
Ahahahahaha!
I'll make this quick!
Your mammon or your lyfe!
I'll gut you like a mossback!
Hurry up and die already, so I can take your stuff!
You won't leave this place alive!
I'll show you a real fight!
Can't wait to count out your coin...!
Time to end this little game!
You picked a bad time to get lost, friend!
Well ain't this a surprise!
Your skin will make a fine rug, fool!
Ha, I think you're bleeding!
Die, damn you!
I'll mount your head on my wall!
You're dead! Dead!
I'll have your head!
That all you've got?!
Prepare to die!
You're a disgrace to Beowricke!
I think i'm doing the Gods' a favor with this one!
First you, then that city!
Prepare to meet the Veil, cunt!
This was the last mistake you'll ever make!
Lookie here. Looks like we got ourselves a free purse!
Tell you what. You start running so I can stab you in the back!
Gonna split your belly like an old woman's purse!
You'll be so much easier to rob when you're dead!
Do not test me, fool!
