Your zennies or your life!
Never should have come here!
Gonna cut your belly open like a blueblood's purse!
Your coin or your life!
Beware, stranger! Thou art being robbed!
Tragedy befalls ye!
Get 'em, boys!
Let's hope this one is more fun than the last!
Start running!
Time to pay thine highway tax, sire!
This one looks like they've got something good!
Let's see if you put up a better fight than the last fool!
I'll make this quick!
You are nothing before me!
You will fall like the rest!
You can not stop the inevitable!
MATTHIOS calls for your head!
Five zenars says I can cut you in half with the next STRIKE!
Die, fool!
You will pay for your insolence!
You are nothing before the power of the GILDWYRM!
Suffer well!
My master MATTHIOS demands your BLOOD!
You are nothing before the Daemons!
Fall before my prowess!
You are nothing before us!
You stand not a chance!
You will die like the last idiot that came before me!
That city will be mine, and there's nothing you can do about it!
That city will be for MATTHIOS, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Is that blood I see? This will be over soon, then!
Time to die!
Maybe if you give me all your coin, i'll let you live!
Maybe if you prostrate yourself before me, i'll let you live!
Time to end this little game!
You picked a bad time to get lost, friend!
Well ain't this a surprise!
Your skin will make a fine rug, fool!
Ha, I think you're bleeding!
Die, damn you!
I'll mount your head on my wall!
You're dead! Dead!
I'll have your head!
That all you've got?!
Prepare to die!
I'll gut you like a mossback!
Everything has a price.. even your life!
