Praise be the Khan!
Long live the tribe!
I could use some mead right now...
So far away from home...
The Khagan would be proud of us.
We'll find a nice slave.
I could use a warm fire and a belly full of mead.
Shh, did you hear that?
Stay alert!
Keep your eyes peeled.
I think I heard something.
Keep your blade sharp.
Bah, stupid land... stupid weather.
I spit on these southerners.
Raining again...
So Hungry...
I need more moondust...
Beware!
Aren't you worried someone will wander in here? The entrance isn't exactly hidden, you know.
What was that?
Is someone there?
...mead, mead, mead... ...kill 'em to get some beer every now and then.. Stupid bees and their stupid honey...
..kill him... he talks like that to me again... get him while he's sleeping, or poison his meat...see how he likes that...
...gonna start keepin' a knife in my boot... tired of gettin' disarmed...
I think we've gone too far from home.
I already miss the ice.
We will strike soon.
