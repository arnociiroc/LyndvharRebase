Praise be the Khan!
Long live the tribe!
I could use some mead right now...
So far away from home...
The Khagan would be proud of us.
We'll find a nice slave.
I could use a warm fire and a belly full of mead.
Shh, did you hear that?
Stay alert!
Keep your eyes peeled.
I think I heard something.
Keep your blade sharp.
Bah, stupid land... stupid weather.
I spit on these southerners.
Raining again...
So Hungry...
I need more moondust...
Beware!
