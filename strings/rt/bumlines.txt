I hate this place.
Fucking richfolk.
Tear Lyndvhar down again.
I heard the Lord is going to run away.
Give me mammon...
Give me food...
I'm so hungry...
I'm starving...
I hate that guy.
Worthless town.
Worthless life.
I wish I was home. They were supposed to protect us.
I saw Stillwater.
I've been to three or four stars. I don't remember.
I don't remember.
I'm going to wish for your health next time I see a shooting star.

I'm the iced cream man.
Another rainy afternoon...
Fog?
The fog.
Coal.
Gem.
A CORPSE; I AM LIVING ON A FUCKING CORPSE.
She was the happiest corpse I'd ever seen.
That was a rough nite. I hope that never happens again.
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?
I don't trust all these foreigners walking around.
