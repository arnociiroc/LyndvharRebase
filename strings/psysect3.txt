PSLM 2:10... Purity afloat! Psydon's blade struck down the Archdaemons, so that it could be made anew!
PSLM 14:12... Up the PSY! Down the Z! The ARCHDAEMON's LUX must be burnt out, so that it may never return again!
PSLM 36:32... PSYDON yet LYVES and PSYDON yet ENDURES! Let none say that THE WEEPING GOD is heartless!
PSLM 54:75... HIS faithful armies prevail! Behold; the SACRIFICE made MANIFEST!
PSLM 71:6... With every broken bone, I swore I lyved! For HE stood with me, and HE hath gifted me the strength to ENDURE!
PSLM 79:38... PSYDON HATES YOU! BE CAST INTO THE BLISTERING PYRES, AND BURN AWAY 'TIL NAUGHT-BUT-ASH REMAINS!
PSLM 81:59... AND HE COMMANDED; "SHATTER THEM APART, LIKE A POTTER'S VESSEL AGAINST THE STONES!" AND SO, WE STRUCK!
PSLM 89:99... THERE IS YET HOPE FOR MAN! EVIL SHALL NEVER TRIUMPH OVER GOOD, AS LONG AS THE FAITHFUL PERSIST!
PSLM 91:3... PSYDON LOVES YOU! NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU HAVE FALLEN, YOU ARE STILL HIS CHILD! SUBMIT TO REDEMPTION!
